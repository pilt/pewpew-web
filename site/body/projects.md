## Projects

### Sektionscafé Baljan
[Sektionscafé Baljan](http://baljan.org) is a coffeeshop managed and run
by students at [Linköping University](http://liu.se). In 2010, I did
non-profit contracting work for the organization and wrote software to replace
current systems for work scheduling, job openings, orders using student
identification cards, and intra-organizational communication. The project
included behind-the-curtains work such as reverse-engineering and developing
routines for migrating old systems.

The bulk of the code is written in [Python](http://python.org) using the [Django
web framework](http://djangoproject.com). The existence of numerous excellent
open source initiatives helped in carrying out the project without straining the
non-profit's budget with license fees and to prevent vendor lock-in.
Recognition goes to 
the [Celery project](http://celeryproject.org/) and
[RabbitMQ](http://www.rabbitmq.com/),
[ReportLab](http://www.reportlab.com/), 
[PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/), 
[PuLP](https://www.coin-or.org/PuLP/) (LP modeler),
[mlmmj](http://mlmmj.org/) (mailing list manager),
[pyscard](http://pyscard.sourceforge.net/) and
[PCSC-Lite](http://pcsclite.alioth.debian.org/), and 
the folks at [Fedora](http://fedoraproject.org/) and 
[Red Hat](http://www.redhat.com).
I also want to thank the IT department at
[Kårservice](http://karservice.se/english) and the [department for LiU
cards](http://www.student.liu.se/liu-kortet?l=en&sc=true) for their support in
helping our servers communicate with the university's central IT systems.

### Open Source Projects
I have provided patches and bug reports to a number of open source projects.
When I see fit, I release projects of my own under OSI approved licenses. See my
[github profile](http://github.com/pilt) for samples.
